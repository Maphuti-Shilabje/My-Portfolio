        <p>
          I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a knack for creating elegant solutions in the least amount of time. 
          Currently pursuing my BSc in Computer Science at the University of Cape Town, I'm always eager to take on new challenges 
          and expand my skill set. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, playing chess, or 
          contributing to open-source projects.
